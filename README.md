# EasyDS_Api
This project is inspired by the Data Professor's ML Web App series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXvmqg8hc70&t=301s

Through using streamlit api I was able to create a no-code method to constructing data visualizations and data modeling. All backend code can be found in the app.py along with trace amounts of frontend. The gui interface is imported from streamlit. 

I wanted to create this project to avoid repeating code in other projects and classes. I think this project could help those who are struggling with finding which models work best for their specific dataset by enabling them to try several models at once. I think this project could also be useful for those who don't know how to code but would still like to see how different models perform on their data.

Currently updating regression to work with k-fold, do not use. There are also some problems with select classification algorithms from switching to kfold cross-validation, this problem will be resolved soon. 

Future additions:
- Time Series Analysis
- DeepFakes
