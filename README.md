# EasyDS_Api
This project is inspired by the Data Professor's ML Web App series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXvmqg8hc70&t=301s

Through using streamlit I am able to create a no-code method to create data visualizations and data modeling. All backend code can be found in the app.py along with trace amounts of frontend. The gui interface is imported from streamlit. 

I wanted to create this project to avoid repeating code in other projects and classes. I also wanted to create this project to help those who are struggling with finding which models work best for their specific dataset. I think this project could also be useful for those who don't know how to code but would still like to see how different models perform on their data.
