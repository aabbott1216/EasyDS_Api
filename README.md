# EasyDS_Api
This project is inspired by the Data Professor's ML Web App series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXvmqg8hc70&t=301s

Through using streamlit I am able to create a no-code method to create data visualizations and data modeling. All backend code can be found in the app.py along with trace amounts of frontend. The gui interface is imported from streamlit. 

I wanted to create this project to avoid repeating code in other projects and classes. I believe that coding will most be streamlined through techniques like this for data analysts because of time saved.
