This project is inspired by the Data Professor's ML Web App series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXvmqg8hc70&t=301s

Through using streamlit I am able to create a no-code method to create data visualizations and data modeling. All backend code can be found in the app.py along with trace amounts of frontend. The gui interface is
imported from streamlit.
